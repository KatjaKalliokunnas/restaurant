# AngRestaurant

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.5.

## General

This project is my school practise work. The idea of this project is to select a restaurant where to order food. In restaurant's page there is a meny where to select portions that you want to order. Orders go to the shopping cart where you can enter your address information. The work contains no backend logic at all. The in-memory-web-app has been used as a fake server and space management has been implemented with the help of localStorage. Angular Materials has been used in the implementation of the layout.
